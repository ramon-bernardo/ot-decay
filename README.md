# OT Decay

A project designed to demonstrate an efficient approach for managing decay mechanics. It defines components, events and systems for handling the decay lifecycle of entities, allowing them to decay over time.

## Concept
This project draws inspiration from the decay management principles found in [The Forgotten Server](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver), particularly in how it handles the [lifecycle of items](https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Item_Decay). The decay system manages the lifecycle of game entities by periodically checking their decay state and executing appropriate decay actions based on defined criteria.
